                Named the Pink City of India for its trademark color, Jaipur is the capital city of the Indian state 
                of Rajasthan. Built by the architect Vidhyadhar Bhattacharya on the command of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh 
                II, Jaipur holds the distinction of being the first planned city in India. Nicknamed the Island of Glory 
                by Sir C.V. Raman, Jaipur is a wonderland of culture and heritage, brimming with architectural gems.
