                Kathmandu, also known as Kantipur, is the capital and jewel of the mountain country of Nepal. Kathmandu's 
                serene and spiritual environment attract people all over the world. Kathmandu is an enchanting conglomeration 
                of medieval architecture and traffic chaos. It is a perfect mixture of traffic, art galleries, museums, sticky 
                scent of temple offerings, cooing doves, marketplaces and the only way to see this wonder of mankind is by foot.
