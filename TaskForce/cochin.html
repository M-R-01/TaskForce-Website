                Cochin, or Kochi is a port city in the South Indian state of Kerala. Known as the queen of the 
                Arabian sea, it flaunts one of the finest natural harbours in the world. Kochi is spread over a 
                series of islands and criss-crossed by backwaters and the sea. One can experience the perfect blend 
                of old world charm, leisure and cosmopolitan culture here.

                Kochi has a typical tropical climate. Palm groves can be found in abundance in Cochin and make for a 
                pretty sight.  Fort Kochi, a charming seaside settlement, houses Dutch, Portuguese and British colonial 
                architecture. Cantilevered Chinese fishing nets are a common sighting in Cochin. Watching the fishermen 
                at their work is a fascinating sight. Cochin is the go-to place for sea-lovers and people who want to 
                experience the nostalgic time of the 17th century. For a good experience in your stay, book a room in 
                a heritage hotel which are basically old buildings turned into hotels, for example a lighthouse, overlooking 
                the sea, transformed into a hotel. Exciting, right???
